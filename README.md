# STAT 555 Project: Decoding Blood Cell Differentiation with ATAC- and RNA-seq

This project explores the molecular mechanisms driving hematopoietic differentiation, with a focus on the erythroid lineage. By integrating **RNA-seq** and **ATAC-seq** data from four hematopoietic cell types—**HSC**, **CMP**, **CFUE**, and **ERY**—we perform the comparisons of six cell pairs to investigate how changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility coordinate during hematopoiesis.

## Objectives
- Indicate differentially expressed genes and accessible chromatin regions from RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data.
- Compare the efficiency of limma-voom and DESeq2.
- Interpret biological functions through Gene Ontology (GO) analysis.

## Tools & Methods
- RNA-seq analysis by limma and DESeq2 for gene expression quantification.
- ATAC-seq analysis by DESeq2 for chromatin accessibility profiling.
- Hierarchical clustering, scatterplots, and GO enrichment analysis.
